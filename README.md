# Landscape of LQG problems

This repository contains the MATLAB scripts for reproducing the experiments in our paper

1) Yang Zheng*, Yujie Tang*, and Na Li (2020). Analysis of the Optimization Landscape of Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) Control. under preparation. A preliminary version is here: [LINK](https://zhengy09.github.io/papers/LQG_landscape.pdf)  (*Equal contribution)
 

## Instructions
The gradient descent algorithms are implemented in 
* LQG_gd_cano.m (partial gradient over the controllable canonical form) 
* LQG_gd_full.m (full gradient)

Run Example_Doyle.m to see some performance; more examples are included in the *Examples* folder.
